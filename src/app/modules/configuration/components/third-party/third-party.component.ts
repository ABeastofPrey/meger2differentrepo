                  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

                  1. Definitions.

                     "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
                     and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

                     "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
                     the copyright owner that is granting the License.

                     "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
                     other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
                     control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
                     "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
                     direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
                     otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
                     outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

                     "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
                     exercising permissions granted by this License.

                     "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
                     including but not limited to software source code, documentation
                     source, and configuration files.

                     "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
                     transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
                     not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
                     and conversions to other media types.

                     "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
                     Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
                     copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
                     (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

                     "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
                     form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
                     editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
                     represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
                     of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
                     separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
                     the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

                     "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
                     the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
                     to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
                     submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
                     or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
                     the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
                     means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
                     to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
                     communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
                     and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
                     Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
                     excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                     designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

                     "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
                     on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
                     subsequently incorporated within the Work.

                  2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                     copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                     publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                     Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

                  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                     (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                     use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                     where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                     by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                     Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                     with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                     institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                     cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                     or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                     or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                     granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                     as of the date such litigation is filed.

                  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                     Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                     modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                     meet the following conditions:

                     (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                         Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

                     (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                         stating that You changed the files; and

                     (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                         that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                         attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                         excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                         the Derivative Works; and

                     (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                         distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                         include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                         within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                         pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                         of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                         as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                         documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                         within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                         wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                         of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                         do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                         notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                         or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                         that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                         as modifying the License.

                     You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                     may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                     for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                     for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                     reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                     the conditions stated in this License.

                  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                     any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                     by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                     this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                     Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                     the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                     with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

                  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                     names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                     except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                     origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

                  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                     agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                     Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                     WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                     implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                     of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                     PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                     appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                     risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

                  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                     whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                     unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                     negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                     liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                     incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                     result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                     Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                     work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                     other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                     has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

                  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                     the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                     and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                     or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                     License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                     on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                     of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                     defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                     incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                     of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                  APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

                     To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                     boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
                     replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                     the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                     comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                     file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                     same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                     identification within third-party archives.

                           separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
                           the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

                           "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
                           the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
                           to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
                           submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
                           or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
                           the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
                           means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
                           to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
                           communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
                           and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
                           Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
                           excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                           designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

                           "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
                           on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
                           subsequently incorporated within the Work.

                        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                           this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                           worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                           copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                           publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                           Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

                        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                           this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                           worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                           (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                           use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                           where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                           by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                           Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                           with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                           institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                           cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                           or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                           or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                           granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                           as of the date such litigation is filed.

                        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                           Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                           modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                           meet the following conditions:

                           (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                               Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

                           (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                               stating that You changed the files; and

                           (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                               that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                               attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                               excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                               the Derivative Works; and

                           (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                               distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                               include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                               within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                               pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                               of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                               as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                               documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                               within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                               wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                               of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                               do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                               notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                               or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                               that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                               as modifying the License.

                           You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                           may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                           for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                           for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                           reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                           the conditions stated in this License.

                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                           any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                           by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                           this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                           Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                           the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                           with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

                        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                           names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                           except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                           origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

                        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                           agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                           Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                           WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                           implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                           of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                           PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                           appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                           risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

                        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                           whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                           unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                           negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                           liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                           incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                           result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                           Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                           work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                           other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                           has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                           the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                           and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                           or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                           License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                           on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                           of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                           defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                           incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                           of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

                    This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.
                    This license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at: http://scripts.sil.org/OFL

                    SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
                    —————————————————————————————-

                    PREAMBLE
                    The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.

                    The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

                    DEFINITIONS
                    “Font Software” refers to the set of files released by the Copyright Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may include source files, build scripts and documentation.

                    “Reserved Font Name” refers to any names specified as such after the copyright statement(s).

                    “Original Version” refers to the collection of Font Software components as distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

                    “Modified Version” refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting, or substituting—in part or in whole—any of the components of the Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a new environment.

                    “Author” refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

                    PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
                    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify, redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font Software, subject to the following conditions:

                    1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components, in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

                    2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled, redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

                    3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as presented to the users.

                    4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written permission.

                    5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the Font Software.

                    TERMINATION
                    This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are not met.

                    DISCLAIMER
                    THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT.
